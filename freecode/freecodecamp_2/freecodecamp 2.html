                        <p>Before Bowie came, David Jones, born on the 8th of January 1947, was already craving the spotlights. He studied in 
                            Bromley Technical Highschool, were he studied artistic and musical practices.</p>
                        <p>He founded his first rock 'n' roll band, the Konrads, in 1962 and has the ambition to become a pop star. He eventually 
                            left the Konrads for the King Bees with whom he'll only remain for less than a month before joining the Manish Boys. </p>

                        <p>The first thing that might come in mind when mentionning Bowie is his fascination for space, which he displayed

                        <p>From Space Oddity in 1969, to Blackstar in 2016, Bowie contributed largely to the space rock culture, which was a 
                            major musical movement in the 60-70s, with a specific focus on outfits and sounds.</p>
                        <p>He made himself famous with his alias personalities, such as Major Tom, an astronaut who'll eventually be stuck in his 
                            spaceship, Ziggy Stardust, an alien rockstar, Aladdin Sane...</p>

                        <p>Bowie was really well known for his novel look on technology and culture. His musical arrangements involved original 
                            instruments and techniques, such as with Space Oddity and its Mellotron. In his later career, he even used computer 
                            assisted techniques, for example for Hallo Spaceboy's lyrics writing . </p>
                        <p>His approach to art was ubiquituous and involved painting, filming, writing, music...  </p> 
                        <p>Bowie also understood the novelty of Internet, and created his owned Internet Provider named BowieNet. Even if the 
                            concept would eventually be extremely successful in the following, at the time it didn't really hit the spot, and 
                            the project was cancelled.

                        <p>Bowie's career often related to mental health issues. His brother, as well as other members of his family were affected
                            by schizophrenia. He often suffered from depression and always feared to also become mentally insane.
                        </p>
                        <p>He expressed this fear by writing songs. Examples involve All The Madmen, The Prisoner, his persona of Aladdin Sane </p>
                        <p>However, he did put himself into states of controll loss, by consuming drugs throughout his whole career. This had an 
                            particularly big impact on his career as it created the persona of "The Thin White Duke", who was extremely controversial.
                            His addiction to drugs led him to even more experimental music, with for example the album "Station to Station" which he 
                            didn't remember writing due to blackouts. But it also came with lifelong consequences and probably did have a role in his
                            death from cancer.

                        <p>David Bowie was known for his particular appearance in his early career, with his colorful looks as he portrayed his 
                            most famous character, Ziggy. Altogether, he did not care to pay respect to gender norms, and adopted an androgynous
                            look. He is today an inspiration for artist like Harry Styles, who was on the cover of Vogue with a dress, just as 
                            Bowie posed in a dress for "The Man Who Sold The World"'s cover.</p>
                        <p>He also didn't mind to be open about his thoughts on queer culture, and did talk about his bisexuality multiple times. </p>
                        <p>Finally, he experimented a lot, with controversial lyrics in "China Girl", "I'm Afraid of America", "Ashes to Ashes". Bowie
                            would always be there where he wasn't expected. He wrote his last album knowing about his upcoming death, and managed to 
                            surprise everybody with completely knew aesthetics, while remaining true to his past self, paying tribute to the start of 
                            his career, and fascination for space.
