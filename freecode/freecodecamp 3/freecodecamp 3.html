            <p>Your Girlfriend<span class="copyright">©</span> has strong feelings that might lead her to burst out in tears unexpectedly. Be patient with your Girlfriend<span class="copyright">©</span>, as this is a sign of emotional or physical distress that might have accumulated over time.
                To avoid this kind of situation, it is imperative to take care of your Girlfriend<span class="copyright">©</span> correctly (ref. <a href="#Emotional_Needs">Emotional Needs</a>).
                <br> Here are a few potential reasons for a breakdown :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You are emotionally unavailable to her</li>
                    <li>She didn't eat all day long (ref <a href="Feed_Your_Girlfriend">Feed Your Girlfriend</a>)</li>
                    <li>She called her mom</li>
                    <li>You don't pay attention to her feelings</li>
                    <li>She is experiencing a general stressful time</li>
                    <li>You hurt her feelings without apologizing</li>
                    <li>You don't answer her texts / calls for a prolonged period of time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You also have your own needs and your Girlfriend<span class="copyright">©</span> should not come across your boundaries. However, it may come to the point where both of you are simultaneously lacking regards for the other's needs. 
                    Keep in mind that it is not appropriate to always let your Girlfriend<span class="copyright">©</span> prioritize your needs over hers. Each of you should be able to prioritize the other's needs from time to time.</p>

                <p>You should always make sure to take care of your Girlfriend<span class="copyright">©</span> after a breakdown, as she will be in a weak state of mind afterwards. Never let your Girlfriend<span class="copyright">©</span> deal with it on her own unless she told you so.
                    <br>Here are some things you could do to help your Girlfriend<span class="copyright">©</span> getting out of a breakdown.</p>
